**Build a Electron Distance Sensor**

In this experiment you are going to build a sensor able to measure distances from 10cm up to 200cm. The data will be transmitted via cell to a cloud service.

**Required Parts**

To build this sensor you need the following hardware:

- 1x breadboard
- 1x Particle Electron
- 1x HC-SR04 sensor
- 1x 470 Ohm resistor
- 1x 1k Ohm resistor
- 4x male to female wires

**Prepare your laptop**

[**https://docs.particle.io/guide/tools-and-features/cli/photon/**](https://docs.particle.io/guide/tools-and-features/cli/photon/)

**Wire up the circuit on breadboard**

Place components as shown in the schema.

The HC-SR04 sensor is a 5V device while the Electron operates at 3.3V. Therefore, we provide power to the sensor from the Vin pin (= 5V from USB).

The 2 resistors function as a voltage divider to convert 5V coming from the sensor to a safe 3.3V level.

R1: 470 Ohm (yellow purple black black [brown])
R2: 1k Ohm (brown black black brown [brown])

**Connect Particle to the cloud**

**Identify device**

First you want to know the Device ID of the Photon you just connected.
```
$ particle identify

Your device id is 2300211353337353037
Your IMEI is 35316207243
Your ICCID is 8936500002860393
Your system firmware version is 0.7.0
```
Copy this device id in your TextPad, you will need it in a few moments.

Photon status LED, it should be BREADING CYAN when it&#39;s happily connected to the internet.

Add device to your account (See Mario, Cristina)

Write sketch for the Photon

Open the online build environment of Particle.io on build.particle.io.

At the left-hand side you can see the vertical menu which you will use during the process. Hover you mouse over each item to get familiar with the different options:



**FLASH** - **VERIFY**  - **SAVE** - **CODE** - **LIBRARIES**  - **DOCS**  - **DEVICES** - **SETTINGS**

**Let&#39;s get started!**

- First we want to select the Photon we connected to our account in the previous step. From the menu, press DEVICES
- Check if your device is listed and select it by clicking the yellow star in front of the device name.
- From the menu, press &quot;\&lt; \&gt;&quot; Code to open the code editor
- Press CREATE NEW APP and enter a Title (e.g. MyFloodMeasuring  )
- Again at the left-hand side press Libraries (first item below &quot;\&lt; \&gt;&quot;)
- In the Community Libraries search box type: HC\_SR04
- Press on the search result HC\_SR04
- Press INCLUDE IN APP, select the app you just created (e.g. MyFloodMeasuring) and press ADD TO THIS APP



Paste the code fromgit url, https://github.com/Code-for-Miami/iot-flood-tracker/blob/master/GiveMeData.ino replacing it&#39;s current content

- From the menu, press VERIFY.
This should result in the message Code verified! Great work.
- Now you are ready to press FLASH
If everything goes well, you will get a:
Flash successful! Please wait a moment while your device is updated...
- The device should return to breading cyan status color

#### **Monitor the published sensor values**

Debug readings from local serial port (Photon need to be connected to USB)
```
$ particle serial monitor
Opening serial monitor for com port: "/dev/tty.usbmodem1411"
Serial monitor opened successfully:
